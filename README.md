# Hotel_Reservation_Analysis-SQL

This project Hotel Reservation Analysis using SQL is part of my internship at Mentorness.

## Overview:
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In this project, I worked with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. Used SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.

## Dataset Details:
The dataset includes the following columns: 

- Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation. 
- no_of_adults: The number of adults in the reservation. 
- no_of_children: The number of children in the reservation. 
- no_of_weekend_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekends. 
- no_of_week_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekdays. 
- type_of_meal_plan: The meal plan chosen by the guests. 
- room_type_reserved: The type of room reserved by the guests. 
- lead_time: The number of days between booking and arrival. 
- arrival_date: The date of arrival. 
- market_segment_type: The market segment to which the reservation belongs. 
- avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation. 
- booking_status: The status of the booking.
